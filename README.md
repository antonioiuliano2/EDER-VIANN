# EDER-VIANN
Emulsion Data Event Reconstruction - Vertex Identification by using Artificial Neural Networks
Release 1

This README just serves as a very short user guide, the documentation will be written much later

Installation steps
--

1) pip3 install tensorflow==1.14.0 --user
2) pip3 install keras==2.3.1 --user
3) pip3 install tensorflow-gpu==1.14.0 --user
   Only required if you have intent to create/train CNN models
4) go to your home directory on AFS where you would like to install the package
5) git clone https://github.com/FilipsFedotovs/EDER-VIANN/
6) cd EDER-VIANN/
7) python3 setup.py
8) The installation will require another directory, please enter the location on EOS where you would like to keep data and the models
   Has to provide up to 10-100 GB of storage depending on whether particular components of the framework is used. An example of the input is /eos/user/<username      first letter>/<user name> . In theory AFS work location also can be specified but it is not recommended.
9) The installer will copy and analyse existing data and the pre-trained model, it might take 5-10 minutes.
10) if the message 'EDER-VIANN setup is successfully completed' is displayed, it means that the package is ready for work

Additional info
--
1) It is recomended to run those processes on lxplus in the tmux shell as some scripts can take up to several hours to execute.
2) The script name prefixes indicate what kind of opeartions this script perform: R is for acrual reconstruction routines, E for evaluation and M for model cration and training.
3) In general the numbers in prefixes reflect the order at which scripts have to be executed e.g: R1, R2,R3...
4) --help argument provides all the available run arguments of a script
5) The output of each script has the same prefix as the script that generates it. If script generates a temporary output for another script it will have the double prefix e.g: R2_R3 etc.
6) The files that are the final output have names with capital letters only such as: R5_REC_VERTICES
   Those files are not deleted after execution. If not all letters in the file are capitalised that means that the file is temporary and will be eventually deleted by the package once it is not needed anymore.
7) The screen output of the scripts is colour coded: 
   - White for routine operations
   - Blue for the file and folder locations
   - Green for successful operation completions
   - Yellow for warnings and non-critical errors.
   - Red for critical errors.
8) Once the program successfully executes it will leave a following message before exiting: 
   "###### End of the program #####"


Vertex Reconstruction
--
1) Please make sure that you have a file with hits that there were reconstructed as Tracks.
   Following columns are required: 
   - Track ID Quadrant or Event ID (if MC truth track reconstruction data is used)
   - Track ID (FEDRA or MC depending which data is used)
   - x-coordinates of the track hits
   - y-coordinates of the track hits
   - z-coordinates of the track hits

2) Please open $AFS/EDER_VIANN/Code/Utilities/Parameters.py and check that the lines between 6-13 
   Within the list of naming conventions correspond to headers in the file that you intend to use.

3) Check the 'CNN_Model_Name' variable - it has the name of the Model that is used for reconstruction (included in the package). If you wish to use your own,        please place it in the $EOS/EDER_VIANN/Models and change the 'CNN_Model_Name' variable accordingly. You might need to change resolution and MaxX, MaxY, MaxZ      parameters if the model was trained with images that have had different size because the model might fail.

4) If happy, save and close the file.

5) cd ..

6) tmux 
   please note the number of lxplus machine at which tmux session is logged in

7) kinit your<username>@CERN.CH -l 24h00m

8) python3 R1_PrepareRecData.py --Xmin 50000 --Xmax 60000 --Ymin 50000 --Ymax 60000 --Track FEDRA --f $<your file with reconstructed tracks> 
   
   min and max value arguments can be changed or completely removed if all ECC data to be reconstructed. Track type can be changed to MC if Monte-Carlo truth        track reconstruction data is used. The script can take 1-5 minutes depending on the size of the input file. Once it finish it will give the message "The track    data has been created successfully and written to ....' and exit.

9) python3 R2_GenerateSeeds.py --Mode R
   
   The script will send warning, type Y. The program will send HTCondor jobs and exit. The jobs take about an hour.

10) python3 R2_GenerateSeeds.py --Mode C
    
    It will check whether the HTCondor jobs have been completed, if not it will give a warning.
    If the jobs are completed it will remove duplicates from the seeds and generate the following message: "Seed generation is completed".

11) python3 R3_FilterSeeds.py --Mode R
    
    The script will send warning, type Y. The program will send HTCondor jobs and exit. The jobs can take few hours.

12) python3 python3 R3_FilterSeeds.py --Mode C 
    
    It will check whether the HTCondor jobs have been completed, if not it will give a warning.

13) python3 R4_VertexSeeds.py --Mode R 
    
    The script will send warning, type Y. The program will send HTCondor jobs and exit. The jobs can take few hours.

14) python3 R4_VertexSeeds.py --Mode C 
   
    It will check whether the HTCondor jobs have been completed, if not it will give a warning.The output will produce a file R4_REC_SEEDS.csv with a list of seeds with each one given a probability value. 

15) python3 R5_MergeVertices.py 
    
    The execution can take up to several hours if the data size is big. The program will produce the R5_REC_VERTICES file. In the file each line will contain a       list of tracks and the vertex number. The script can be ran with the option '--Acceptance' which takes in account only the seeds with probability above the       given value (has to be between 0 and 1)
   
   
   
EDER-VIANN Vertex Reconstruction Evaluation
--
Can only be used if there is a data available with MC vertex truth information.
   
1) python3 E1_PrepareEvalData.py --Xmin 50000 --Xmax 60000 --Ymin 50000 --Ymax 60000 --Track FEDRA --f $<your file with reconstructed tracks> 
   
   min and max value arguments have to match those that were used in for previous phase in Step 7).
   The script can take 1-5 minutes depending on the size of the input file.
   Once it finish it will give the message "The track data has been created successfully and written to ....' and exit.

2) python3 E2_GenerateEvalSeeds.py --Mode C 
   
   The script will send warning, type Y. The program will send HTCondor jobs and exit. The jobs take about an hour.

3) python3 E2_GenerateEvalSeeds.py --Mode C 
   
   It will check whether the HTCondor jobs have been completed, if not it will give a warning.
   If the jobs are completed it will remove duplicates from the seeds and generate the following message: "Seed generation is completed".
   
4) python3 E3_DecorateEvalSeeds.py --Mode R 
   
   The script will send warning, type Y. The program will send HTCondor jobs and exit. The jobs take about an hour.
   
5) python3 E3_DecorateEvalSeeds.py --Mode C
   
   It will check whether the HTCondor jobs have been completed, if not it will give a warning.
   The output will generate the file E3_TRUTH_SEEDS.csv that contains all seeds that have a common Mother ID. This file has additional information on the Seeds      such as opening angle, DOCA etc. This file is used to assess the perfromance of the EDER-VIANN and FEDRA reconstruction accuracy.

The X and Y bounds are exclusive (they define the portion of the ECC     data that is not used in training). Track type can be changed to MC if Monte-Carlo truth track reconstruction data is used.
