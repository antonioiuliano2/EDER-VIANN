# EDER-VIANN
Emulsion Data Event Reconstruction - Vertex Identification by using Artificial Neural Networks.
Release 1.

This README just serves as a very short user guide, the documentation will be written much later.

Installation steps
--
1) pip3 install --upgrade pip

   This step is highly recommended in order to avoid possible problems with intallation of other packages.

3) pip3 install tensorflow==1.14.0 --user

4) pip3 install keras==2.3.1 --user

5) pip3 install tensorflow-gpu==1.14.0 --user
   
   Only required if you have intent to create/train CNN models

6) pip3 install pandas
   
   Pandas are used extensively in this package for routine data manipulation.

7) pip3 install psutil
   
   This utility helps to monitor the script memory usage

8) pip3 install 'h5py==2.10.0' --force-reinstall
   
   Downgrading h5py in order to make it work with the existing version of the Tensorflow.

9) go to your home directory on AFS where you would like to install the package

10) git clone https://github.com/FilipsFedotovs/EDER-VIANN/
11) cd EDER-VIANN/
12) python3 setup.py
13) The installation will require another directory, please enter the location on EOS where you would like to keep data and the models
   Has to provide up to 10-100 GB of storage depending on whether particular components of the framework is used. An example of the input is /eos/user/<username      first letter>/<user name> . In theory AFS work location also can be specified but it is not recommended.
14) The installer will copy and analyse existing data and the pre-trained model, it might take 5-10 minutes.
15) if the message 'EDER-VIANN setup is successfully completed' is displayed, it means that the package is ready for work

Additional info
--
1) It is recomended to run those processes on lxplus in the tmux shell as some scripts can take up to several hours to execute.
2) The script name prefixes indicate what kind of opeartions this script perform: R is for acrual reconstruction routines, E for evaluation and M for model cration and training.
3) In general the numbers in prefixes reflect the order at which scripts have to be executed e.g: R1, R2,R3...
4) --help argument provides all the available run arguments of a script and its purpose.
5) The output of each script has the same prefix as the script that generates it. If script generates a temporary output for another script it will have the double prefix e.g: R2_R3 etc.
6) The files that are the final output have names with capital letters only such as: R5_REC_VERTICES
   Those files are not deleted after execution. If not all letters in the file are capitalised that means that the file is temporary and will be eventually deleted by the package once it is not needed anymore.
7) The screen output of the scripts is colour coded: 
   - White for routine operations
   - Blue for the file and folder locations
   - Green for successful operation completions
   - Yellow for warnings and non-critical errors.
   - Red for critical errors.
8) Once the program successfully executes it will leave a following message before exiting: 
   "###### End of the program #####"


Vertex Reconstruction
--
1) Please make sure that you have a file with hits that there were reconstructed as Tracks.
   Following columns are required: 
   - Track ID Quadrant or Event ID (if MC truth track reconstruction data is used)
   - Track ID (FEDRA or MC depending which data is used)
   - x-coordinates of the track hits
   - y-coordinates of the track hits
   - z-coordinates of the track hits

2) Please open $AFS/EDER_VIANN/Code/Utilities/Parameters.py and check that the lines between 6-13 
   Within the list of naming conventions correspond to headers in the file that you intend to use.

3) Check the 'CNN_Model_Name' variable - it has the name of the Model that is used for reconstruction (included in the package). If you wish to use your own,        please place it in the $EOS/EDER_VIANN/Models and change the 'CNN_Model_Name' variable accordingly. You might need to change resolution and MaxX, MaxY, MaxZ      parameters if the model was trained with images that have had different size because the model might fail.

4) If happy, save and close the file.

5) cd ..

6) tmux 
   please note the number of lxplus machine at which tmux session is logged in

   FYI: min and max value arguments can be changed or completely removed if all ECC data to be reconstructed. Track type can be changed to MC if Monte-Carlo truth        track reconstruction data is used. The script can take 1-5 minutes depending on the size of the input file. Once it finish it will give the message "The          track    data has been created successfully and written to ....' and exit.

    The output will produce a file R4_REC_SEEDS.csv with a list of seeds with each one given a probability value. 

15) python3 R5_MergeVertices.py 
    
    Purpose: This script takes vertex-fitted 2-track seed candidates from previous step and merges them if seeds have a common track.
    FYI: The execution can take up to several hours if the data size is big. The program will produce the R5_REC_VERTICES file. 
    In the file each line will contain a list of tracks and the vertex number. 
    The script can be ran with the option '--Acceptance' which takes in account only the seeds with probability above the given value (has to be between 0 and 1)
